                            The Abel Tasman Coast Track is a 5-day hike, 51 kilometers (or ~32 miles), described as one
                            of New Zealand’s Great Walks, being the perfect way to explore the unmatchable beauty of the
                            Abel Tasman National Park. There is beauty in growth, especially difficult growth, and as we
                            embarked on this 5-day backpacking hike, beauty grew the longer we walked. Growth throughout
                            my DNP journey also grew in beauty the further I got into my education, and not just because
                            I was closer to graduation, although that does feel so magnificent. This growth is
                            exemplified in the NONPF competencies, growth through the University of Mary Core
                            Competencies, and demonstrating the Doctorate Essentials and Program Outcomes. These are

                    </a>
                    <h3>NONPF competencies 2, 3, 6, 10</h3>
                    <p>This assignment is an oral case presentation of a patient from my clinical rotation. This
                        assignment allowed me to identify pathophysiology, clinical decision making, a management plan,
                        and medication management, both encompassing traditional and functional medicine. I was able to
                        apply evidence-based resources like the North American Menopause Society Position Statement on
                        Hormone Therapy, with special interest in sharing this information with fellow students, as this
                        remains a more specialized area of medicine. This care continues to evolve and hopefully will
                        become standardized care for all menopausal women. This clinical case exemplifies the importance
                        of the interprofessional team, including OB-GYNs and genetic testing professionals. My personal
                        and professional leadership have evolved through extensive education and passion for women’s
                        health, and I hope to help educate others, like my classmates, on the importance of this
                        information and the quality of life for female patients. </p>

                    <p>This literature review on abnormal uterine bleeding demonstrates patient-centered care with this
                        diagnosis encompassing many different baseline etiologies for why the bleeding has occurred. The
                        incorporation of the red flag symptoms and do-not-miss diagnoses highlights the importance of
                        healthcare systems and the interprofessional team members. Additionally, technology and
                        information literacy are exemplified through the teaching of PowerPoint to other students and
                        colleagues within the DNP class. With current research always being released, this PowerPoint is
                        tailored to evidence-based practice, involving practice guidance and application of high-quality
                        information into occupational knowledge.</p>

                    <p>This tort case study, completed in my law and policy class, demonstrates my ability to identify
                        unethical and illegal actions in a patient case scenario. This case highlights the topics of
                        negligence and unethical acts committed by a healthcare provider within a small rural facility.
                        The assignment focuses on steps toward resolution as a nurse leader, which demonstrates my
                        ability to resolve an unethical situation professionally. Negligence is necessary to report at
                        both an organizational level and to certifying bodies, thus, understanding the appropriate chain
                        of command for reporting within my career was learned throughout this assignment.</p>

                        assignment allowed me to utilize informatics and healthcare technology to understand the needs
                        around this problem, evaluate evidence, transform it into scholarship, to meet the needs of the
                        DNP project grounded in evidence-based practice. Additionally, making informed decisions and
                        continued learning aided in professional acumen.</p>

                        have passed required exams, clinical cases/hot seats, and completed 1000 clinical hours. Within
                        this program, I have been given the tools necessary to advance professionally as a student into
                        a provider utilizing research and evidence-based medicine. </p>
                    <p>With the New Zealand journey that led me to go back to school, I will continue to utilize what I
                        learned along the way, including fighting for women’s rights to paid maternity leave, holistic
                        care aimed toward women, and further supporting the health of families in the community in which
                        I am working.</p>

                <p><span class="text-italic">Reflection:</span> Throughout my clinical experiences I observed different
                    communication styles between
                    professors, preceptors, and interdisciplinary team members. Communication is the foundation of
                    positive interactions, and is essential to building a strong professional relationship with
                    patients. A deeper understanding of patients, the type of communication they feel supported with and
                    thrive with, reflects a provider who listens and understands. Further, communication is reflected in
                    the way a provider charts or tells the patient’s story. The patient’s story gives other healthcare
                    providers or interprofessional team members the ability to see background, treatments and
                    medications that were effective or not effective, and comprehensiveness. It has the ability to
                    communicate the whole picture.</p>

                        throughout
                        the years including lab values, diagnostic testing, or failed medications. Although technology
                        can
                        be incredibly useful and comprehensive, the ability to tell a patient’s story through the HPI
                        with
                        inclusive information listed above gives other providers and interprofessional team members the
                        ability to understand a patient and their health story. Like the ability to present a patient to
                        preceptors in a concise, organized manner, learning how to chart is an important piece of
                        communication and gives an accurate description of communication skills.</p>

                        This is the foundation to nursing practice and application, adding to my ability to personalize
                        management and treatment for patients, grounded in evidence-based practice. Continued research
                        and education throughout my career is necessary to the ever changing healthcare system and to
                        meet the diverse needs of patients.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>This assignment was a research based assignment around hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
                        breast cancer. This research continues to evolve with recognition of false claims made by the
                        Women’s Health Initiative study on HRT causing breast cancer. This example of scholarship
                        displays my skills of researching evidence-based practice, and applying it to clinical settings.
                        Although the stigma remains on HRT and its dangers, evidence provided in studies evaluated
                        throughout this paper, along with continue research being released, can have life-changing
                        impacts on care for women and their quality of life.</p>

            <h2>Demonstrating the Doctorate Essentials and Program Outcomes</h2>
            <a class="link-button" href="assets/Case Presentation primary M.Macke.pptx" target="_blank">
                Oral Case Presentation - Subclavian Steal Syndrome
            </a>
            <h3>Doctoral Essentials I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII; Program Outcomes 1,3,4,5,6</h3>
            <p>This presentation was based off a clinical case in my primary care rotation. This case provided a
                challenging case of both management of care, and patient resistance. The case specifically highlighted
                the pathophysiology, management and treatment, care within the interdisciplinary team, and giving me the
                ability to compile the case to present to my DNP class. Special attention within the teaching powerpoint
                focused on pertinent findings, and support of diagnosis and treatment. The engagement of the class was
                identified with the complexity of the case.</p>

            <a class="link-button" href="assets/Health policy compendium pwpt M.macke.pptx" target="_blank">
                Health Policy Compendium on Paid Maternity Leave
            </a>
            <h3>Doctoral Essentials I,V, VI; Program outcomes 2,4,6</h3>
            <p>This assignment allowed me a practical experience in developing tools targeted at addressing a health
                policy of interest, paid maternity leave, at both the state and federal levels. This presentation is a
                compilation of assignments including a health policy scholarly paper, policy brief, opinion editorial, a
                testimony aimed at a governing body (MT governor), and finally a compendium of all of these assignments
                which is linked above. Growth as an advocate for mothers within the state of MT and at a federal level
                was developed and understood through this assignment. Fighting for awareness of a policy to this degree,
                and expanding the knowledge of others was the main focus with each different entity of delivery.</p>

                Leadership Development Tool
            </a>
            <h3>Doctorate Essentials: II, V, VI; Program Outcomes 2,4,5,6</h3>
            <p>This assignment aided in me reaching many doctoral essentials and program outcomes. This assignment
                focused on multiple leadership self-assessments, then researching and discussing qualities necessary to
                be an effective servant leader. I was then able to make a leadership development plan to help guide me
                in achieving these qualities. Enhancing leadership skills is essential to promote an environment of
                health and growth as an advanced practice registered nurse. This assignment enabled me to further
                augment working within the interdisciplinary team which is a critical component of the doctoral
                essential and program outcomes.</p>

                Postpartum Depression Literature Review and Synthesis
            </a>
            <h3>Doctoral Essentials: II, III, IV, V, VIII; Program Outcomes: 4,6</h3>
            <p>This assignment was a part of my DNP project, but exemplifies both doctoral essentials and program
                outcome components. I was able to collaborate and synthesize evidence-based research, allowing our team
                to develop a PICO question. This compiled pertinent internal and external data to confidently identify a
                need for research, and specific gaps in the care of postpartum mothers. I am confident in my skills to
                break down evidence-based resources to improve patient care with this information.</p>

            <h3><span class="text-underline">Self-Reflection/Professional Growth</span></h3>
            <p>The assignments above represent only a small reflection of my competence in the 8 doctoral essentials and
                the 6 program outcomes throughout my graduate program. I will continue to grow in these competencies
                both professionally and personally, but believe my obtained competency will prepare me for this growth.
                I am thankful for the education that I have received from the University of Mary, both at the
                undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
            <p>I plan to continue growth at the local, state, and national level by fighting for the rights of women and
                families, with a focus on paid maternity leave. I hope to be able to provide courses for teenagers and
                young women within the community of Helena on natural family planning and cycling tracking to better
                understand their body and their hormones. I hope to empower girls and women with this information!</p>
