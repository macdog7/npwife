                        <p>This DNP project aimed to create a consistent process to ensure all mothers and healthcare
                            professionals
                            are well-informed about postpartum depression and that patients receive consistent,
                            thorough,

                            timely
                            care. As mothers, we felt deeply passionate about the importance of caring for postpartum
                            mothers,
                            with
                            special interest in Cheryl Beck's Theory on Postpartum Depression. This research allowed me
                            to
                            deep
                            dive
                            into the literature about caring and treating postpartum mothers, with the development of an
                            education
                            initiative for a small midwest North Dakota womenâ€™s clinic. The goal of the education was
                            focused on
                            improving postpartum follow-up, and recognizing and managing postpartum depression. This
                            project
                            was
                            successfully defended on April 9th, 2025.

                <p>The final day of the Abel Tasman Track, a boat picks individuals up and takes them back to the start
                    of the track. The 32 miles covered hiking is seen in such a different view, you conquered it. The
                    beauty of it, experienced hiking with a 30-50lb backpack is so much different than the beauty of
                    looking back at everything you accomplished, resting, in awe of it. The journey of DNP school seems
                    so similar, and reflecting back on this journey makes it that much more beautiful. Looking back on
                    the circumstances that changed my path throughout school is similar to the boat ride back after the
                    very long 5 days of hiking. Becoming a mother of two; learning to love things I thought I could
                    never love- womenâ€™s health; building beautiful relationships with professors, preceptors, and
                    patients all added to my personal and professional growth. I am so fortunate for this journey and
                    cannot wait to continue onward, but never forgetting to look back and reflect on the beauty.
