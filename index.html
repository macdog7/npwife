                        An international move to Wellington, New Zealand changed it all for me and my family. The
                        ability to see life in a different lens, along with the growth presented through the
                        unfamiliarity of an international registered nursing career.

                        Moving to New Zealand for a job opportunity for my husband brought along itâ€™s own opportunities
                        for me. It not only opened up my eyes to the world around me, but the type of care I could have
                        the opportunity to provide to patients with an extension of school. A foundation made in what I
                        already had such a deep passion for, nursing. This portfolio will take the reader down a
                        compilation of artifacts that demonstrate achievement of competencies for advanced nursing
                        positions, along with exemplifying a lifelong commitment to learning, personal growth, and
                        professional excellence.

                    husband moved to Wellington, New Zealand for an amazing opportunity. She obtained her nursing
                    license there, practicing for 2 years on a general surgery, vascular, and ENT ward. Megan and her
                    husband moved back to the U.S. six months pregnant to be closer to family and to start working on
                    her Doctor of Nursing Practice Family Nurse Practitioner in May of 2021. She is continuing her
                    education through the University of Mary with expected graduation April, 2025. Megan comes from a
                    long line of nurses following both her mother and grandmother into the profession. At present, Megan
                    is taking on motherhood and school. She ran collegiately and still continues to enjoy running with
                    her goldendoodle, spending time with her family at their lake cabin in Montana, and traveling.
